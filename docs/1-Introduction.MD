# Intro

## Requirements

Macro-bf allows us to include files, which is very important to use the lib, you have to download macro-bf and the content in the src.
I also highly recommend to go check the docs of macro-bf before which you can find here : https://github.com/StercusMax/macro-bf

## Content
The rest of the folder will contain infos about size required by the lib
