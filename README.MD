# notabrainfuck-stdlib

An attempt to make a brainfuck utility lib using the macro system i made : https://github.com/StercusMax/macro-bf

# Goal 
Brainfuck is an hard language, so i created a macro system like you can see on top. However that's still not enough, that's always good to have a sort of basic utility lib, often called as "stdlib" in other languages.
So as long you use macro-bf you can use this lib, the goal of this lib is being cross compilers/interpreters compatible, no assumption, that comes however with a price of speed and some harder usages for the implementations who vary.

You can see a complete guide of usage in the docs folder
